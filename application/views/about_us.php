				<p>Athreya Hospital is a truly class leading specialty hospital primarily focused on providing the full range of women and child care facilities, catering to people from all sections of the society.</p>
				
<p>In the ever burgeoning urban environment, the most essential care for women and children are taking a back seat. This is partly because of the lack of time, inaccessibility of existing healthcare facilities and lack of single facility offering all services related to women and children. Lack of care of children and women is to the ultimate detriment of the society. </p>
 <p> At Athreya Hospital, it is our endeavor to serve the people the best by being closest to them. We are located on Chandapura, Anekal main road, which is conveniently accessible by all people from Electronic City and surrounding areas. Our maternal and child health set-up is fully geared to cater to all kinds of primary, secondary and tertiary health care needs of women and children. Led by a team of experienced paediatricianâ€™s and gynaecologists, Athreya Hospital has round the clock emergencies with fully equipped and staffed neonatal and adult intensive care units. In addition, Athreya Hospital also offers speciality care in other disciplines such as surgery, orthopaedics, gastroenterology, general medicine and cardiology.</p>
<p> In a time when world class healthcare is slowly getting beyond the reach of many, we at Athreya Hospital have been conscious of this fact and have tried to structure our facility in a way that it can be accessed by people from all walks of the society. Today, with a 60 bedded uniquely designed ultra-modern facility boasting of a multitude of class leading diagnostic and therapeutic set-up, we offer the same world class healthcare with ward options to people of all strata of the society. From our innovative and class leading general wards to ultra-deluxe suites to the discerning, we make affordable and world class healthcare possible under one roof. </p>
<p>  It is our constant endeavor to take world-class modern and holistic medicine to masses and yet retaining the essential element of human compassion in our practice. At Athreya Hospital, we would want to assure our patients and their loved ones with the best of the facilities & care in a modern healthcare setting.</p>
<p> In addition to our modern practice, we at Athreya Hospital believe that most of modern day ailments are life-style and stress related and therefore preventable. Health issues such as allergies, respiratory, skin & metabolic disorders, anxiety and mental stress, etc, are poignant examples in this regard. We strongly believe that the remedy for most of these health issues lies in our traditional Indian practice of yoga. Yoga as a means to healthy living and remedy for ailments is proven in most scientific literature and has been embraced by many developed countries. Through a combination of yogic practices, periodic yoga camps, health education and nurturing a spirit of universal brotherhood, Athreya Hospital strives to accomplish holistic healthcare. </p>
<p>This effort makes us closer to the needs and realities of our patients as humans.  At Athreya Hospital, we derive our biggest strength from the traditions of excellence and caring not only for our patients but also for their loved ones.</p>
